list of assumptions regarding this project

Assumptions I have made when designing this soltuion - 

1. It is assumed that the PoS which talks to this API is secure and is able to take card payments / currency in-order to top-up the users balance.
    This will be the value of the 'ammount' attribute in the body of the POST request.
2. it is assumed that the PoS will create a final total 'bill' which is to be subtracted from the users balance.
    This will be the value of the 'ammount' attribute in the body of the POST request.
3. It is assumed that the API will be running within the PoS local network.
4. It is assumed that the PoS system will know to collect the UserID from the employee card and it will know to send that via a HTPP GET request using the ID 
    as the first parameter on the /users/ endpoint.
5. It is also assumed that the PoS system will know to append the users pin which the will enter (via touchscreen) as the second parameter to the users/ endpoint
    e.g /users/UserIDHere/UserPinHere
6. is it assumed that the PoS system will know to send any balance changes to the API via POST request while using the BODY of the POST
    request to define the ammount to be either subtracted or added to user balance.
