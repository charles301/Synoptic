I plan on using express js as a server to host the API.
I will use a local DynamoDB instance for local development
I will write this in javascript for the sake of time and ease of development
I will require multiple endpoints for signing in, registering, making a payment and topping up credit. I will also have an endpoint which returns
the entire contents of the database. 

I will test manually using postman for the sake of ease of development, rather than spending a large chunk of time wiritng unit tests for tried 
and tested javascript packages.

I havent dealt much with sessions in relation to APIs, I plan on using cookies for the API to know whether the user is authenticated.
